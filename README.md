# Lazer Theramin Synth Badge

This year we wanted to do something different. Our idea is to use two laser time of flight sensors that can measure the distance of your hands moving around infront of the badge to control a synthesizer to create a laser theremin.

- 64Mhz Arm CortexM4F with Bluetooth 5
