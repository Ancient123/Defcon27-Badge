Thanks for purchasing our 2019 Badge!

*Operation*

The badge has two modes of operation, light mode and sound mode. Clicking in the rotary encoder will switch between the two.

The buttons along the bottom will switch light patterns or play sounds in their coresponding modes.

In sound mode, the two lazer rangefinders on the sides of the badge will measure how far away your hands are from them. The left sensor will control volume, and the right sensor will control sound.
